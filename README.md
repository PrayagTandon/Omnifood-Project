- Pictures + Testimonials

#### Setting the development environment

- To make the website responsive from start I used relative units for lengths such as rem, percentage instead of px
* Set the font-size of the root element of the page to **62.5%** to make it easier for calculation(Default font size of browser is 16px so, 62.5% will convert it into 10px and thus 1 rem = 10px).
+ Font size and spacing system defined:
```
Font sizes (px)
10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98
Letter spacing(px)
2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

```
- Code Editor: VS Code
